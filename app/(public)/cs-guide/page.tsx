                Hello there, We are thrilled to have you here! Whether
                you&apos;re new or returning, our mission is to empower students
                with the skills, knowledge, and connections necessary to excel
                in Computer Science (CS) and enhance their university
                experience. We achieve this through workshops on trending
                technologies, community-building activities, and opportunities
                to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.
              </p>
              <p>
                This guide is designed to help you successfully navigate the CS
                seas as a student at Brock University.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the guide, we will review everything you need to know
                about the Computer Science Program. This is an open-source guide
                for Computer Science students at Brock University. We encourage
                and appreciate everyone’s contributions to its continuous growth
                and development.

                ⚠ Tip: When selecting a context credit, make sure to read the
                course description and see that you are interested in the
                course. We understand that sometimes you just want to learn
                about your major but they are intended to provide you with a
                broad educational background. Sometimes, it can get frustrating
                trying to find a context credit that fits your schedule but we
                highly recommend spending time on this decision. An extra 15
                minutes on this can drastically change your overall experience
                for the next semester or even the entire academic year. (In
                Jay’s opinion, most of the time there’s no point in taking a
                bird course, it’s a waste of time and money.)
